Assignment/Exercises 
Topics covered : Modules,Functions,Looping,Conditional constructs,Input,Output,Collections :
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Create a program named "my_list_store"
which support following operations on list named "members" which is provided by the user 
for ex: ["Pratiksha","Kevin","Sachin","Yuvraj","Sania"] is provided by the user 

Operations supported by our program are :
  1:  Display number of elements in the members list
  2:  Add an element to the members collection like 'Sehwag' 
  3:  Add elements to the members collection like ['David','Bret','Sanju']
  4:  Remove a member from the collection at a given subscript
  5:  Remove the last member from the collection 
  6:  Display third, fourth and fifth element from the collection 

Keep asking the user for the operation in this store untill he chooses to exit from the program

2) Create a program named "my_dict_store" which support following operations on 
dictionary named "capitals" which would have keys as their country and values as their capitals
respectively from the user
for ex: "India" : "New Delhi" ,"USA" : "Washington DC","Nepal": "Kathmandu","Ukraine" : "Kyiv"
is provided by the user 

Operations supported by our program are :
    1: Display number of elements in the capitals collection
    2: Add an element to the capitals collection like --> Afghanistan: Kabul
    3: Add multiple elements to the capitals collection like -->  Albania:Tirana,Algeria:Algiers,Andorra:Andorra la Vella
    4: Remove an element from the collection 	

Keep asking the user for the operation in this store untill he chooses to exit from the program


3)  Create a program named "my_set_store" which support following operations on two sets
    provided by user 

for ex: 
	A = {1,2,3,4,5}
	B = {18,19,20,21}
is provided by the user

Operations supported by our program are :
	1: Union
	2: Intersection 
	3: A-B
	4: B-A
	5: Take a element from user and Display if that element is a member of set B 
	6: Display number of elements in the set A
    7: Display number of elements in the set B
	8: Add an element taken from the user to the set A
	9: Add multiple elements taken from the user to the set A
	10: Remove an element taken from the user from set A

4) Take a number from the user and print fibonacci sequence till that number USING Range function 
	eg : fibonnaci sequence for 5 is 1,2,3,5 """
5) create a function named factorial() that takes in a number and displays the factorial of that number 
6) create a function that  take a number from the user and returns a list of  even numbers from 1 to that number      
7) create a function that takes in a number from the user and returns a tuple of all Odd numbers from 1 to that number 
8) create a function that takes in temperature in Celsius and returns temperature in Farenhiet
9) create a function that takes in date of birth from the user and returns age in days of the user 


#??) create a lambda function take a number from the user and print all prime numbers from 1 to that number
